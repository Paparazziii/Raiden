# Raiden

The project was worked for Raiden Game design. The project was separated into four parts - Bullet, Enemy, Player and Supply. There is a main structure which constructed all these parts together. 

The game followed the same struture as Raiden - the game published by Tecmo in 1990. 

This is a base structure which could only be run by Python.
